# Guidelines for use #

You may want to experiment with the general configuration settings. E.g. for wider displays, you could increase max lengths and vice-versa.  Please note that caching
is switched on by default and set to expire every 5 minutes (300) for a user session by default.

## Using the slider on course pages ##

There is custom block region on course pages in the Adaptable theme called "course page slider region", designed for use with the news slider.  
See basic instructions below:

1. Add the news slider to the "Course slider" block region that can be seen by admins on the frontpage.  Configure it to appear on all pages.
2. Go to any course page. You should the news slider appear just above course content. Now configure this block to appear only on course pages.
